### Project Name = UDPort

# PLEASE READ

# THIS IS NOT THE NFT MARKETPLACE (SRY I TANGLED UP THE GITHUB LINKS IN MY NEW HACKATHON SUBMISSION).
# If you are coming from https://gitcoin.co/issue/28808 , pls redirect to this github project from me:
# https://github.com/Stefan1612/UD-Hackathon-NFT-Market , this is the actual NFT Marketplace submitted as project for this specific bounty (https://gitcoin.co/issue/28808)





### To-do's
- Host website on netlify instead of Github Pages - Github Pages has some weird interactions with Redirects.
- Rewrite frontend with MUI instead of Bootstrap
- Allow the Portfolio to track ALL ERC20's.
- Use a subgraph to grab historic data instead of centralized Coin Gecko API

## Approach
Useable for every network
A portfolio app which allows the user to EITHER log in via Unstoppable DOMAIN or via metamask.
Fetches all ERC20's instantely and visualizes their Historic data.
